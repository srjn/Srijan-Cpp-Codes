/*In this example:

t1, t2, and t3 are all separate threads.

Each thread starts its task when created.

t1.join() makes the main thread wait until t1 finishes.

t2.join() makes the main thread wait until t2 finishes.

t3.join() makes the main thread wait until t3 finishes.

Without these join() calls, the main thread might finish and terminate the program before the threads complete their tasks.
Itâ€™s like telling the main thread, "Hold on, wait until these threads are done before you move on."*/
